The video we uploaded to our Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7G03rhRC2U) explains the basics of monday.com webhooks and how they work. The webhook integration allows you to subscribe to certain events on your monday.com board. Your app will receive a notification when these events happen so your app can react to those events.

Here's an example that you can follow to add a webhook to your board.

Before adding the webhook, follow these steps:

1. Find a monday.com board that you can run tests on.
2. Install an IDE of your choice (we are using Visual Studio Code).
3. Install Node (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
4. Download this repository.
5. In the terminal, run "npm install" in the repository's root folder.
6. Follow the instructions in the video.
